Look closely to your daily thoughts and reactions. Are they rooted in a fixed or a growth mindset? Being aware is the first path to change.\n\nStep 2: Start changing your language. How you speak to yourself has a profound effect on your mindset. Ditch phrases like \"I can't do this\" to \"I can learn this\".\n\nStep 3: Embrace challenges. A growth mindset see challenges as opportunities to grow. Each hurdle represents an opportunity to learn something new.\n\nStep 4: Replace the word 'Failing' with 'Learning'. Our setbacks are our best teachers. Remember, it's not about the destination, it's about what you learn on the way.\n\nStep 5: Celebrate growth with others. Sharing your progress and celebrating others' can help to change your beliefs about success and failure. \n\nRemember, growth is a journey, not a destination. Keep learning. Keep growing. âœ¨"
