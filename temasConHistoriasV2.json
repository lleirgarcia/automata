Here's how you can master it:\n\nStep 1: Stay present 🧘 It's easy to wander off into your own thoughts. However, when someone is sharing, ensure your focus is solely on them. Resist the urge to interrupt or make assumptions.\n\nStep 2: Empathize 🤝 Try to step into the other person's shoes and feel what they're going through. It not only shows you care but also enhances your understanding of their perspective.\n\nStep 3: Non-Verbal cues are clues 👁👂 Notice the speaker's body language, tone, facial expression, and more. These non-verbal signs can offer important insights about their feelings and emotions.\n\nStep 4: Reflect and Validate 👥 Once they're done speaking, don't just move on. Reflect on what they said, acknowledge their feelings, and validate their thoughts. It shows you were really listening.\n\nStep 5: Ask Open Ended Questions 🗝 Avoid just 'yes/no' queries. Ask 'how', 'what' or 'why' questions instead. It encourages a more in-depth conversation and demonstrates your interest in learning more.\n\nRemember, active listening isn't about being silent, it's about being present and engaged. Make it your goal to practice these steps and you'll surely aid your personal growth in spades. 💪👂💗 #activelistening #personalgrowth #communication #selfdevelopment "
