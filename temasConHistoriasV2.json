Be specific. Set benchmarks to track your progress.\n\nStep 2: Create a Daily Routine - Consistency is key. Even if you only spend a few minutes each day, make learning a non-negotiable part of your daily routine. \n\nStep 3: Seek Out Resources - Books, podcasts, courses, mentors - the resources out there are endless. Find what works best for you and dive in.\n\nStep 4: Implement Immediately - The best way to truly learn something is to use it.
