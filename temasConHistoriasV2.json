Remember, virtue lies not just in shining through your successes, but persisting when the going gets tough. Here are familiar yet meaningfully different steps to help you cultivate those vital qualities.\n\nstep 1: Identify Your passions. Pursuit of your passions naturally instills tenacity and helps overcome resistance. It adds colour to your life and fuels your commitment. \n\nstep 2: Practice daily affirmations. Speak strength into your life. Tell yourself each day, \"I am tenacious, I am steadfast\". The more you say it, the more you believe it and in turn, manifest it.\n\nstep 3: Surround yourself with positive influences. Their strength, tenacity and positivity will rub off on you, inspiring you to be resilient and persistent.\n\nstep 4: Embrace failure. Remember, failure isnâ€™t the opposite of success, it's part of it. Itâ€™s okay to fail. Each time you overcome a failure, your resistance to it grows and you become more tenacious.\n\nstep 5: Silence the noise around you. Learn to focus on your journey and not to get swayed by othersâ€™ opinions. Your path is your own, and every step towards it builds resistance and tenacity.\n\nRemember to keep pushing, keep believing, and most importantly, keep going no matter what. The keys to your success lie within you. Don't forget that setbacks are steps forward in disguise. Dream big, act now and never give up!"
