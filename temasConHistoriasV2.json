The sooner you start saving for retirement, the more time the money has to grow through compound interest.\n\nStep 2: Contribute as much as you can to your pension fund. Often, employers offer a match which should not be left on the table as it's effectively free money!\n\nStep 3: Diversify your investments. This lowers risks and increases chances for returns over the long run.\n\nStep 4: Review your pension plan annually. This lets you know if you're on track and whether any changes need to be made.\n\nStep 5: Seek professional advice. Financial planners can help optimize your pension strategy keeping your retirement goals in mind.\n\nAnd remember, patience is key when it comes to investments!"
