Train your body to follow a regular sleep pattern.\n\n⏲ Step✌️- Unplug for at least an hour before going to bed. Limit screen time from phones, computers, or TV as they can stimulate your brain and prevent you from falling asleep quickly.\n\n🚫 Step👌- Avoid consuming caffeine or alcohol before going to bed. These can disrupt your sleep cycle and prevent a restful night's sleep.\n\n🧘‍♂️ Step👍- Incorporate relaxation techniques into your nightly routine. This could be reading a book, practicing yoga or meditation, or taking a warm bath. \n\n🛏 Step✋- Make your sleeping environment cozy and conducive for rest. This might mean investing in a comfortable mattress, using darkening curtains, or using a white noise machine.\n\nNighty night, sleep tight, don't let the bed bugs bite! 🌙💤🛏\""
