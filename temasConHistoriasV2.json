Break your to-dos into manageable tasks that require equal amounts of time and energy ideally over the following week. \n\nStep 2️⃣: Assign Time-Blocks. Dedicate specific blocks of time to each task. For instance, dedicate your morning time to creative tasks, your afternoons for meetings, and evenings for personal time. Don't forget to fit in some breathers. \n\nStep 3️⃣: Use a Planner. Keep track of your time and tasks with a planner, it could be an app or old school paper and pen. Long-term consistency is key! 📘🖊 Remember, this is a flexible guide and not cast in stone. Adjust it to suit your rhythm and lifestyle. Happy planning! 👍🏼💡🗓 #Wellbeing #TimeManagement #Planning #InstagramGuide"
