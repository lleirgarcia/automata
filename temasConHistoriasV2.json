Let's get started!\n\nStep🔢: Wake up early ⏰ The early hours provide tranquility and time for you but this doesn’t necessarily mean 5 am, you just need to make sure to wake up earlier than usual. Add at least 15 minutes to your normal wake-up time, you'll notice the difference!\n\nStep✌: Hydrate 💧Your body is dehydrated after an 8-hour sleep cycle. A glass of water first thing in the morning will jump-start your metabolism and re-hydrate you.\n\nStep👌: Meditation 🧘‍♂️ Take a few minutes (even 5 minutes works) to meditate which leads to greater focus during the day. Being higher on the mindfulness scale improves cognition, reduces distractions, and helps manage stress better.\n\nStep👆🤘: Exercise 🏋️ Developing a daily exercise routine creates a positive flow of energy and keeps you motivated. It could be any form of fitness routine you enjoy.\n\nStep 🤚🏻: Plan Your Day 📝 It may sound cliché but it helps you organize thoughts, keep track of tasks, and create a productive structure for the day.\n\nImplement this routine for a week and share your changes! #MorningRoutine #SuccessHabits #GoodMorning."
